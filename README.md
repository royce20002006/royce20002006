# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Royce Calvin â€“ an aspiring Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for creating efficient, scalable, and user-centered applications. My tech stack includes **JavaScript**, **Python**, **React**, **Redux**, **Express**, and **Flask**, with experience in both **frontend** and **backend** development.

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy bringing ideas to life, whether through designing smooth, responsive user interfaces or building robust server-side solutions. Some of my recent projects include:
- **Rainbow BnB**: A seamless booking platform, leveraging Redux for efficient state management and React for a fluid single-page experience.
- **Twister**: A Twitter clone built with Flask and Python on the backend, styled with raw CSS and deployed consistently across environments using Docker.
- **ScheduleMe**: A scheduling app with a fully integrated backend using Sequelize and Postgres, styled for user-friendly navigation and optimized data handling.

ðŸ”§ Beyond coding, I'm driven by a love for problem-solving and continuous learning. Iâ€™m always looking to expand my skill set and take on new challenges.
